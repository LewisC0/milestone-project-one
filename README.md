user stories

As a user interested in music and reviews, I want:

. A clear rating system, which shows the reviewers overall thoughts about the music.
. Well written reviews.

Text throughout the website is in Roboto font style. Roboto is a very well designed modern font which is very easy to read and looks great on any number of devices.

. Home - The front page of the website, featuring a hero banner, some information about the website and some calls to action for the user.
