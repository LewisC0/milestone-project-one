## Project Goals

The primary goal of LCReviews is to provide a website space dedicated to providing users with reviews of their favouritie musicians and bands. The main target audience is anyone with an appreciation
and curiosity towards music.

## User Stories

As a user interested in music and reviews, I want:

- A visually appealing website, which is easy to understand.
- The ability to easily find the reviews of albums or bands, that I am specifically looking for.
- A clear rating system, which shows the reviewers overall thoughts about the music.
- Well written reviews.

# Design Choices


## Font

Text throughout the website is in Roboto font style. Roboto is a very well designed modern font which is very easy to read and looks great on any number of devices.


Page Layout

My website has a home page, and then 2 other pages, that being a Contact page and a list of Album reviews.

- Home - The front page of the website, featuring a hero banner, some information about the website and some calls to action for the user.
- Contact - A contact form which lets the user contact me to suggest albums to review
- Album list - A page dedicated to presenting the albums I have reviewed to the user.
