# LCReviews

## Milestone Project 1 - Static Front-End Website

LCReviews is my own personal website dedicated to reviewing albums and bands from a variety of genres. The aim of the site is to share my love and passion for music, by expressing my thoughts and opinions on the artists I love. The website is fully responsive across a variety of different devices, allowing for a very positive user experience.

This is my Milestone Project 1 submissionm for Code Institute's course on Web Application Development, which features 3 seperate pages built using HTML, CSS and code libraries such as Bootstrap.

# UX - User Experience

## Project Goals

The primary goal of LCReviews is to provide a website space dedicated to providing users with reviews of their favouritie musicians and bands. The main target audience is anyone with an appreciation
and curiosity towards music.


## User Goals

- A website which is easy to use, navigate and understand
- Easily accessible reviews and recommendation

## Developer Goals

- The website will be easy for users to use and understand
- Visually appealing
- Professional looking website
- Well written code which is reflected in the websites presentation

## User Stories

As a user interested in music and reviews, I want:

- A visually appealing website, which is easy to understand.
- The ability to easily find the reviews of albums or bands, that I am specifically looking for.
- A clear rating system, which shows the reviewers overall thoughts about the music.
- Well written reviews.
- Imagery related to the review, album or band, which makes for clearer navigation.

As a user interested in wanting to see a specific album I enjoy, getting reviewed, I want:

- A visually appealing website, which is easy to understand and navigate
- An easy to use contact form
- A functional contact form


# Design Choices


## Font

Text throughout the website is in Roboto font style. Roboto is a very well designed modern font which is very easy to read and looks great on any number of devices.

## Colour Scheme

Throughout the entire website, I used a very simple 3 colour scheme. The colours contrast very well, which allows for a very clear and easy to use website

Page Layout

My website has a home page, and then 2 other pages, that being a Contact page and a list of Album reviews.

- Home - The front page of the website, featuring a hero banner, some information about the website and some calls to action for the user.
- Contact - A contact form which lets the user contact me to suggest albums to review
- Album list - A page dedicated to presenting the albums I have reviewed to the user.


## Navigation

Each page I created is present in the navbar, which lets the user navigate to each page without issue. The navbar is functional on each created page which lets the user freely travel between each page. Depending on the page the user is currently on, a small underline will appear under the current page in the navigation bar, this shows it is the active page for the user. The navigation bar is not designed to be sticky, so the screen is less cluttered, especially for mobile users.

## Footer

The footer is a simple design, which features contact information, as well as social media links. Just like the header, the footer is not sticky and can only be seen when scrolling to the very bottom of each page. This allows for a less cluttered user experience.
